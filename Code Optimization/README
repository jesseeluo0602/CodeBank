Optimize a single image convolution for image of size 240 by 240. Place your solution in a file called part1.c . You'll find a naive implementation in it already for you to start optimizing on.

We recommend that you implement your optimizations in the following order:

Consider Register Blocking (load data into a register once and then use it several times)
Keep the main line (or few lines) of multiplying and adding in your 2D convolution as uncluttered as possible. You don't want if-statements and such slowing down that main area of computation
Optimize loop ordering (see lab 7)
Use SSE Instructions (see lab 8)
Implement Loop Unrolling (see lab 8)
Compiler Tricks (minor modifications to your source code can cause the compiler to produce a faster program)
