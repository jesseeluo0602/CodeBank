Code the Change
El-Concillio Project
Re-designing El-Concillio's webpage.

What needs to be done:

Deciding what to do with the programs page: do we want to just forego all the empty educational presentations and just update everything that we can see?

Scheduler: What is this page even? Should we help them make a google maps calendar instead? That would still involve their input, though.

Links page: Should be a simple task but I don't know what people want to do with it.

Fixing our header: It's not too stylish at the moment and could definitely be improved.

Getting the e-mail of "Silvia I. Floresa" (or getting updated contact information in general.) - If Terence could e-mail them asking if their contact information is updated, that would be great.
